"Living in the Moment: Discover the Magic of Current Time ðŸŒŸ"

I am thrilled to share that I have successfully created a "Current Time with Random Colour" using JavaScript CSS HTML ðŸŽ‰ðŸ”¥

ðŸŒŸ Check out my work here: https://abhisheklikho.github.io/current-time-and-random-color//current-time-and-random-color/index.html



The project showcases a unique and engaging timekeeping experience called "Current Time." Unlike traditional countdown timers, "Current Time" focuses on the present moment, offering users a real-time view of the current time. The web-based application displays a sleek and stylish interface with large, easy-to-read numbers for hours, minutes, and seconds.



The application utilizes JavaScript to continuously update the displayed time by fetching the current time from the user's device. Additionally, a custom function generates random colors every second, creating a visually captivating experience for users.
